    <h2>Before starting the 7 Day Sugar Detox Programme:</h2>
<section>
    <h3 onclick="showAnswer(this)"><button>+</button>Can someone who is Type I or Type II diabetic take part in the programme?</h3>
<p>Type I diabetic individuals cannot use this supplement.  
However, there is the possibility of someone with Type II diabetes using this product, all being that they are not taking medications, in this case we recommend that you take advice from your healthcare professional.  For those who take medications we recommend that you discuss the supplementation with your GP.</p>

<h3 onclick="showAnswer(this)"><button>+</button>I am pregnant, can I take part in the programme?</h3>
<p>We do not recommend this supplement during pregnancy, nor breastfeeding.</p>

<h3 onclick="showAnswer(this)"><button>+</button>I am taking medication, can I take part in the programme?</h3>
<p>For those taking medication we recommend that you discuss the potential use of this supplement with your GP.</p>

<h3 onclick="showAnswer(this)"><button>+</button>I’m already taking a supplement, do I need to take the Chromium and Cinnamon Complex?</h3>
<p>We would need to know what supplements you currently take, please contact Viridian Nutrition for further advice by contacting <a href="mailto:technical@viridian-nutrition.com">technical@viridian-nutrition.com</a></p>

<h3 onclick="showAnswer(this)"><button>+</button>500ug of Chromium is approximately 2500 x the recommended daily allowance, is this appropriate?</h3>
<p>Currently there is not an upper limit set for chromium, owing to its status as a very safe compound with no evidence of safety or toxicity concerns.  Studies have concluded that 1000mcg daily produced superior therapeutic effects than lower doses.</p>

<h3 onclick="showAnswer(this)"><button>+</button>What are the main side effects to taking part in the programme/Chromium and Cinnamon Complex supplement?</h3>
<p>Some individuals may experience headaches, this is often due to the mobilisation and detoxification of sugar related toxins.  Furthermore the consumption of sugar has an effect on the brain by generating habitual or reward seeking behaviours, subsequently the exclusion of sugar causes the brain to readjust.  A good way to address such headaches is to stay hydrated and take some gentle exercise, such as a 30 minute walk.  It can be useful to address mineral levels, this can be done simply by adding electrolytes to your water; <a href='http://www.viridian-nutrition.com/Shop/Sports-Electrolyte-Fix-Liquid-P698.aspx' target="_blank">http://www.viridian-nutrition.com/Shop/Sports-Electrolyte-Fix-Liquid-P698.aspx</a>   It is a normal reaction and should pass in a couple of days.</p>

<h3 onclick="showAnswer(this)"><button>+</button>What should I do if I feel unwell whilst on the sugar detox programme?</h3>
<p>In the unlikely event you feel unwell during the sugar detox programme, we recommend that you stop the programme, including the supplement and take advice from your healthcare professional, and contact <a href="mailto:technical@viridian-nutrition.com">technical@viridian-nutrition.com</a></p>

<h2>Supplements:</h2>
<section>
<h3 onclick="showAnswer(this)"><button>+</button>What happens if I forget to take the supplement?</h3>
<p>If you forget to take the supplement carry on as directed taking 2 capsules daily, do not take extra in an attempt to make up for those missed.  The app is a great tool to remind you to take your supplement but also providing tips and motivation for the programme.</p>

<h3 onclick="showAnswer(this)"><button>+</button>What happens if I take an extra one by mistake?</h3>
<p>If an extra supplement is taken by mistake don’t take any further capsules for 24 hours then revert to 2 capsules daily.  Ensure you are hydrated by drinking plenty of water daily.  Taking 3 capsules in 24 hours will not produce a negative outcome, however it would provide a greater amount of nutrients.</p>

<h2>Meal planner:</h2>
<section>
<h3 onclick="showAnswer(this)"><button>+</button>I am vegan – will the meal plan be suitable for me?</h3>
<p>The recipes and supplement are vegan, so yes perfect for you.</p>

<h3 onclick="showAnswer(this)"><button>+</button>I follow a gluten-free diet, will the meal plan be suitable for me?</h3>
<p>Each recipe states if any allergens are present.  In terms of gluten, all recipes except the Seedy Mango Bars are gluten free. The supplement is gluten-free.</p>

<h3 onclick="showAnswer(this)"><button>+</button>Do I have to strictly follow the recipes in the 7 Day Sugar Detox meal planner?</h3>
<p>The meals are nutrient rich, the extra provision of nutrients can help reduce cravings so we recommend, where possible, please follow the meal planner.</p>  
    <h3 onclick="showAnswer(this)"><button>+</button>Are there any more similar recipes that I can use for the planner and where can I find them?</h3>
<p>Additional recipes can be found in Oliver McCabe’s Fuel Food book and Dale Pinnock’s Clear Skin Cookbook.</p>

<h2>App:</h2>
<section>
<h3 onclick="showAnswer(this)"><button>+</button>Do I need to use Viridian’s 7 Day Sugar Detox app to complete the sugar detox programme?</h3>

<p>The 7 Day Sugar Detox app will support you every step of the way.  Fill in your personal preferences and details, set your start date then track your progress.  We’ll be alongside you with meal planners, tips and encouragement. If you do not have access to a smartphone and to the app, you can visit our website <a href="http://www.viridian7daysugardetox.com">www.viridian7daysugardetox.com</a></p>
</section>

<h2>After completion of the 7 day detox:</h2>
<section>
<h3 onclick="showAnswer(this)"><button>+</button>What happens after I complete the 7 Day Sugar Detox?</h3>
<p>Now that you have finished you can be more flexible with your diet.  The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that refined sugars contribute less than 5% of your total daily energy intake, which is about 6-7 teaspoons of sugar for adults or about 3-4 teaspoons for children.  Importantly, this is a maximum level, so it is best to consume as little added sugar as possible.  </p>

    <h3 onclick="showAnswer(this)"><button>+</button>What happens if I don’t see a change at the end of my 7 Day sugar detox?</h3>
<p>If the plan and supplementation is followed we guarantee you will feel better by the end of the 7 day sugar detox, if for any reason does not happen, please return your pack to the place of purchase for  full 100% refund.</p>

<h3 onclick="showAnswer(this)"><button>+</button>Can I do the sugar detox programme for another 7 days or longer?</h3>
<p>The 7 day sugar detox is designed to be the start of a sugar-free or sugar-reduced lifestyle. There is no harm in continuing with the programme by purchasing Chromium and Cinnamon Complex 60 capsules or switching to a multivitamin as it offers a good, balanced diet. We suggest Multi Phyto Nutrient Complex. This product contains 200ug of Chromium per daily dose so would continue with effective glucose utilisation. For more meal ideas read, Oliver McCabe’s Fuel Food book provides a greater range of recipes, <a href="http://www.viridian-nutrition.com/shop/The-Fuel-Food-Cookbook-P754.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.viridian-nutrition.com/shop/The-Fuel-Food-Cookbook-P754.aspx</a> </p> 

<h3 onclick="showAnswer(this)"><button>+</button>What do you recommend as a sugar substitute?</h3> 
    <p>If you want to use sweeteners we recommend healthier options such raw honey, maple syrup (not maple flavoured syrup), coconut sugar, xylitol, stevia leaf, blackstrap molasses, 100% fruit jam and dates or date syrup. They have less impact on your blood sugar and have nutritional benefits beyond their sweetness. </p>
